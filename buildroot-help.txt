First Fork upstream buildroot repository to my github account

Now clone the repo:
git clone git@github.com:architnd/buildroot.git

cd buildroot/

checkout lts branch:
git checkout 2024.02.x

Create project branch:
git checkout -b rtls

Push new branch to remote repository:
git push -u origin rtls

Now, make a copy of raspberry pi configuration:
cp configs/raspberrypi3_defconfig configs/raspberrypi3_rtls_defconfig
this file contains buildroot build configuration

Run make with the new configuration:
make raspberrypi3_rtls_defconfig
This will generate .config

Note that dl directory contains al downloaded packages

build buildroot:
make
It will generate images in following directory:
output/images/

check if sd card is already mounted, if it is mounted unmount it:
mount
umount /media/archit/*

flash sd card image to sd card:
sudo dd if=output/images/sdcard.img of=/dev/sdb bs=4M status=progress
sync
